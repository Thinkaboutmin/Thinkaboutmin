### Hello :P

Making a few cool, but undesireful, projects. Basically, nothing that anyone needs... probably.

Want to some info about me? Sure, indulge yourself in it.

I'm a man who considers himself a developer(software engineer?) who eagerly studies a lot of things in the laziest way possible, AKA procastination. Among the things that I have some knowledge range from simple language syntatics (Python and C++) to computer graphics (OpenGL, not gonna lie this one I barely touched hehe).
Among the languages that I have worked with to the point of it being at least a simple hello or some simple conditional operation were:

- C#
- Python
- PHP
- C/C++
- Shell script (Bash mainly)
- Dart
- Javascript
- Java
- Kotlin
- VooDo Magic
- Market Stonks

you get it, right? Althogh maybe something else was forgotten... Oh yeah, reduce this list to 2 languages at best as my memory is short because their STL were long gone from my mind by now :P

Oh, language? I do not mind about language but I still prefer C++ only for the true pain, not a maso ok? :cough: Why? Knowing the nitty gritty (is C really nitty compared to x86 assembly?) things doesn't dull a mind, actually, it teaches the norms from the highers up, hence, this is why some personal projects and maybe any new one will be written in C++ when possible.

Usually, people would put something inspiring or funny here as a gif, hence I will show my truest pain when I dealt with C++

C++ templates are really a beauty sometimes.

Now, move on ~or contact me if any trouble appears in any of my projects.~

*I just follow the simple stonk market logic. If it goes down it will rise itself up thus up fall it will*
